# Flower-Recognition-Kaggle-CNN-Keras
The dataset is Flower Recognition on Kaggle. The dataset consists of 4232 images each of different pixel values. Each of the image can be classified into either of 5 types-> 'Daisy','Rose' etc... . I have trained Convolutional Neural Network written in Keras to predict the flower on the validation set.  Also used ImageDataGenerator to augment the training set and avoid overfitting problem .
